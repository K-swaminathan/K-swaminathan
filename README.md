# Hey there, I'm Swaminathan 🤖🚀

## 🎭 About Me
I'm a **Pre-Final Year Computer Science Student** who speaks fluent Python and occasionally argues with JavaScript. I specialize in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics**, turning caffeine into code and datasets into insights. Passionate about solving real-world problems (or at least debugging them after breaking my own code). Looking to revolutionize Tech, Healthcare, Finance, and E-Commerce—one bug fix at a time! 

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (still trying to befriend async functions 🤯)
- **Web Development**: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Django, Flask (because frontend deserves some love too)
- **Data Science & ML**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, SAS (AI models that don’t just overfit but actually work!)
- **Data Analytics & Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Excel (yes, Excel counts!)
- **Databases & Cloud**: MongoDB, MSSQL, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud, Azure (aka where my data sometimes disappears)
- **Languages**: English, Tamil, Hindi (and fluent in Stack Overflow search queries)
